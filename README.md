## Getting Started
To run this app, follow these steps:

- Install Flutter
- Clone the repository or download the source code for the Quiz App.
- Open the project in your preferred code editor.
- Run the main.dart file to launch the app.

## Usage
- Upon launching the app, you will be presented with a true/false question. 
- You can answer the question by selecting either the "True" or "False" button.

- If your answer is correct, an icon with a green checkmark will be displayed, and your score will increase by 1.
- If your answer is incorrect, an icon with a red "X" will be displayed, and your score will remain the same.

To start a new round of questions, you can tap the refresh icon. This will clear your score and start the quiz from the first question again.

- If you have answered more than 10 questions correctly, the "True" and "False" buttons, as well as the navigation buttons, will be hidden. You will see a summary of your score and a "Next Round" button to start a new round.
